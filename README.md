# Active-Directory-User-Import-using-PowerShell
This repository contains a PowerShell script for importing users into Active Directory from a CSV file. The project includes:

CSV Source File: A structured CSV file containing user information, such as usernames, first names, last names, email addresses, and organizational units (OUs).
PowerShell Script: A script that reads the CSV file and creates user accounts in Active Directory based on the provided data.
Configuration Options: Parameters to customize user attributes, such as setting profile paths, home drives, and more.
This project serves as a practical example of automating user management tasks in Active Directory, making it easier to onboard multiple users efficiently.
